I am a Mathematics major at Thomas Edison State University with an expected graduation date of May 2026.

My academic trajectory traverses many STEM disciplines, including computer science, so I'm quite acquainted with disciplined problem solving and versed in various logic-rich areas. Applying this acquired knowledge in the programming realm, I have demonstrated effective problem solving strategies, creativity, proficiency at writing time and space efficient code, and comprehension of classic algorithms and data structures by successfully solving the Google Foobar programming challenges in algorithm design.
